Whisk in the milk, cream, a generous pinch of salt, pepper to taste, and a pinch of nutmeg.\nSprinkle 1/4 cup of the cheese in the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Spread half the leeks and croutons in the pan and sprinkle with another 1/4 cup cheese. Scatter the remaining leeks and croutons over and top with another 1/4 cup cheese. Pour in enough of the custard mixture to cover the bread and press gently on the bread so it soaks in the milk. Let soak for about 15 minutes.\nAdd the remaining custard, allowing some of the soaked cubes of bread to protrude. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup cheese on top and sprinkle with salt.\nBake for 1 1/2 hours, or until the pudding feels set and the top is brown and bubbling.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 180 C.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404784,"name":"oven","localizedName":"oven","image":"oven.jpg","temperature":{"number":180,"unit":"Celsius"}}]},{"number":2,"step":"Put the leek rounds in a large bowl of tepid water and swish so that any dirt falls to the bottom of the bowl.

Try not to test the bread by sticking the toothpick in the chocolate portions, as the toothpick will always come out with gooey melted chocolate.\nLet the bread cool for at least 45 to 50 minutes before taking it out of the pan for slicing.\nStore any leftovers in sealable container.

Begin by roasting the garlic, jalapenos and bell pepper. Leave the skin on the garlic cloves, wrap in tin foil and place wrapped garlic and all peppers on a cookie sheet; roast for 20 - 25 minutes, until veggies look puffy and skin is browned and flaying away from the flesh of the peppers.  A few minutes after putting the garlic and peppers in the oven, open both bags of collard greens, spread the greens over a cookie sheet and place in oven for 12 minutes with the roasting peppers in order to thaw the greens.\nRemove the greens and roasted veggies from the oven; allow to cool. While cooling, crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Beat eggs, add the grapeseed oil and stir.  Once the greens are cool enough to handle, take large handfuls of the collard greens and squeeze all the water out of them over the sink. Once the water is squeezed out, put the handfuls in the mixing bowl with the egg.  Do this for all of the collards.\nUsing your fingers, remove the skin from the peppers, remove the seeds and chop into small pieces.  Remove the garlic cloves from the foil, remove the skin and coarsely chop the garlic.  Add chopped peppers and garlic to the mixing bowl with the collards and egg.  Add salt and crushed red pepper to the mixing bowl.  Using a fork, mix everything together until everything is coated with egg.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn the collard mixture out on top of the parchment paper.  Using a fork, press mixture firmly into the parchment paper. There is enough in this recipe to cover a 12 x 17 baking sheet, though be prepared to do a lot of pressing in order to evenly disburse the mixture over the full sheet.\nBake in the oven for 30  35 minutes until the edges are just barely beginning to brown and the collards feel dry and firm to the touch.\nAllow to cool and pulling the edges of the parchment paper, place on a chopping block. Chop the bread into desired sizes. This makes 12 decent sized squares. Use for sandwiches, paninis, personal-sized pizzas or eat plain as a snack.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat your oven to 375 degrees.
