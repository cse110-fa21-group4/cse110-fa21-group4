# Bryan's Testing:
## Hidden Cards
Commit edadc21887a7e2496978aae4e740da605eec1b16 on Nov 29,
- Buttons were using the hidden class inappropriately and not dissapearing when they should
- Redid the classlist logic on applying the hidden classes to buttons

## Update/Scaling
Commit 1d2167f9121ae2f685577d4d5924ca60c87379e1 On Nov 30,
- The update feature for scaling our servings had to grab the integer from the page, which means
  that our parser to generate recipe expand had to be updated to adjust for this feature.
- Redid the html generation in recipe expand to account for updating the servings

Commit 2006127d6563ea5f290e335c8484b0e45d463161 On Nov 30,
- Ryan fixed the update servings button and relevant code as we had two different paradigms on how.
  we were interacting with the recipe expand page and the fixes were undone due to large amount
  of pushes and old code went through
- Redid Ryan's fixes.

## Delete Card
Commit 64d146ada40c396303fa32b1b84b5146b15fb784 On Dec 1,
- Deleting from the favorites list did not actually update localstorage to delete the recipe visually
  from both recipe list and favorites.
- Updated the favorites list deletion code to correctly update the map in localstorage

## Reinsert Deleted
Commit 4690b4211c14f30f8d415df262e60e551207bfd2 on Dec 1,
- Reinserting a deleted inserted recipe would not correctly show the recipe in recipe list because the
  deleted class was not applying correctly
- Updated the recipe logic to correctly remove the deleted tag in the html on generation and update

## Recipe Expand Parsing
Commit 682ae0879ff87be19edd4d5a9d1c1ecafd485250 on Dec 1,
- New styling for the ui broke recipe expand's parsing.
- Redid recipe expand's html generation to account for the new ui and updated servings parsing
  to account for the new ui changes also

## Enter Key Binded to 2 text inputs at same time
Commit 8c08471d75bddc30ac94c1550128a414de5fa0bc on Dev 2,
- Fixed a conflicting enter key bug since both add and search bars utilized the same html
  and triggered a overlapping input function.
- New code to differentiate whether a user has the search bar or add bar is active

## Conflicting Inits
Commit 48c6946e3b43a7d3096bdcbf799d5970e050b1ae on Dec 2,
- The fix for the conflicting error key bug was not being correctly applied due to another initialize function
  in a separate file overriding the original fix attempting to do a similar fix.
- Removed the conflicting init function and uncessarry function.

## Deleted Cards still showing up in favorites
Commit 64d146ada40c396303fa32b1b84b5146b15fb784 on Dec 1,
- If a card was favorited and then deleted, it would only disappear in recipe list, not favorites page.
- Updated hidden class to hide the card on favorites too.

# Alanna's Testing:
## 404 Error Undefined Image
Commit bc36c934a831f7c4eb05985e4ce8c8ec88344a00 on Dec 2,
- Testing with 100 recipes, there was a json file not containing an image attribute. When this image was populated
  onto home page or recipe list, a 404 error occured and the image would be blank.
- Inserted a base case into main when fetching. If json doesn't contain image attribute, we will insert our own
  using our logo.

## Scrolling Error
Commit 266b1abb93bb6075d1c240b37e5c70aec66784b0 on Dec 2,
- Bryan and I fixed a scrolling error that occured when a button was attempted access. The code recided in sideBar.js which is also used
  by other pages. When scrolling elsewhere, it would attempt to locate the up-button. Therefore we placed the scrolling code
  in its own file, scrollButton.js, that only recipe list will call.

## Added Recipe updating all hashmaps/warning to user
Commit df34c95761aac59e046b6326a55737bb6c4e9673

Commit c6c9c9957554b65ea9e8fe60ff503aab97cf1184
Commit 7913fd91da3869ef13e931fab4d7b483ea799d63 on Dec 1,
- Claire, Bryan and I tested her add feature extensively. Ran into many base cases we needed to consider, such as
  adding a duplicate recipe that already existed on recipe list page, and re-adding the same recipe after it was deleted.
- Made sure all hashmaps were updated respectively, and also added in alerts to let user know whether they were adding
  a duplicated or re-adding a previously deleted recipe.
- Also fixed the generated ID being just an integer and not being regenerated with a duplicate.

# David Thai's Testing:
## Update button form refreshing page on Enter key
Commit b70aa97cb188504e85821ee845877ccf8a5f7be5 on Dec 6,
- If user input a serving size into the form text area, and decided to click enter instead of
  pressing the submit button, page would refresh without calling the function to scale the ingredients.
- Inserted a function to not refresh the page on enter key, and call the function to update scaling.

# Peicong's Testing:
## SearchKey Test
- Used to return undefined instead object when grab id from localStorage
- Change the id tobe an Json object to test

## AddRecipe Test
- We test "add back" feature to add deleted item back, which didn;'t work due to generate random id, then we try to make each id unique for each new added Recipe by grab it back when we undo delete.
- The delete function for add recipe didn't work due to generate id issue, then we change the id in recipetoHash to make it valid.
- I test add recipe to make it insert at top of list.
