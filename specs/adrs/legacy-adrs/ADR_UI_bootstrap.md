# Responsive webpage using bootstrap

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Han N. & Ryan M
* Date: 11/17/21

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we code our webpage such that it is presented properly regardless of the system the user is on? We want our webpage to be responsive, 
and doing this manually wsith media queries and such can be time consuming. 

## Considered Options

* Bootstrap
* Do it manually using media queries
* Something else like bootstrap (but why)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Bootstrap", because with just one line of code in our header we can easily make our webpage responsive and we don't have to worry about this anymore.

### Positive Consequences

* Responsive website
* Access to bootstrap docs and libraries
* Potentially makes other front-end tasks easier

### Negative Consequences 

* We were encouraged not to use bootstrap out of fear that all our webpages would look the same
* Unknown repercussions of including bootstrap (i.e. performance, scalability, etc.)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Bootstrap

* Good because it allows us to easily make our website responsive
* Good, because one of line code and done
* Bad, because we were encouraged not to use it
* Good/Bad, because we could end up using bootstrap for other things 

### Manually


* Good, because we have complete end-to-end control
* Good, because we are not going against staff recommendations
* Bad, because it will take FOREVER
