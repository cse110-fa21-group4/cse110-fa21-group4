# Developing for this Project

## Issues
In the Issues tab, each issue is a goal on the roadmap that still needs doing. Use these to get a basic understanding of the
state of the project and the direction that development is headed.

## Pull Requests
Direct pushes to the `main` branch are not allowed. In order for your changes to be incorporated into the main codebase, you must
first create a new branch, make your changes on that branch, then make a Pull Request for your branch into `main`. If it passes
all of the tests and is deemed a good change by at least two people in the organization, then it is able to be merged into the
main codebase.

## Projects
The main project board for this repository is automated and gives a visual representation of the state of all issues and pull requests.
There is no additional functionality that cannot be accessed via other tabs, but it is a good way to visualize the project if
you are used to something like Kanban.

## Wiki
In the wiki, there are some useful documents and tutorials to help you with specific aspects of setting up your development
environment to make it as easy as possible for you to develop and make pull requests without issue.

## Documentation
Every source file is documented with JSDoc syntax, and any additions should also be documented in the same way. One can see the documentation
by simply looking in the source file, or by viewing the JSDoc website deployed onto Github Pages [here](https://cse112-sp22-group13.github.io/cse112-sp22-group13/).
