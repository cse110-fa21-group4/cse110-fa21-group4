## [KNEAD IT](https://knead-it.netlify.app)
Knead It is a bread-themed recipe manager designed for use in the browser. Users may create accounts to keep track of their favorite recipes and note down comments about recipes, similar to how they might interact with a physical cookbook.

# Using this project
Simply host the `src` directory using your favorite webserver or hosting service. The app is built from `src/App.js`, `src/index.js`, and `public/index.html`.

# Developing for this Project

## Issues

We use GitHub Issues for issue tracking; each opened issue represents a task that is either on our backlog or is currently being worked on. We use category tags to represent the type of issue (e.g. testing or documentation), as well as a priority tag and complexity tag to help us with deciding what tasks to work on for each sprint.

## Pull Requests

Direct pushes to the `main` branch are not allowed. In order for your changes to be incorporated into the main codebase, you must
first create a new branch, make your changes on that branch, then make a Pull Request for your branch into `main`. If it passes
all of the workflows/checks and is deemed a good change by at least two people in the organization, then it is able to be merged into the
main codebase.

## Projects

The main project board for this repository is an automated Kanban board called "Backlog" and gives a visual representation of the state of all issues and pull requests. Issues start on the "To-do" section if in the backlog, then move through the other sections as developers work on the issues and get them ready for deployment. Once an issue is completed, the task is moved to "Done".

There is no additional functionality that cannot be accessed via other tabs, but it is a good way to visualize the project if
you are used to something like Kanban.

## Wiki

In the wiki, there are some useful documents and tutorials to help you with specific aspects of setting up your development
environment or perform certain tasks to make it as easy as possible for you to develop and make pull requests without issue.

## Documentation

Every source file is documented with JSDoc syntax, and any additions should also be documented in the same way. One can see the documentation
by simply looking in the source file, or by viewing the JSDoc website deployed onto Github Pages [here](https://cse112-sp22-group13.github.io/cse112-sp22-group13/).

# Administrative Resources

Administrative Documentation can be found on the [`docs` branch](https://github.com/cse112-sp22-group13/cse112-sp22-group13/tree/docs).
