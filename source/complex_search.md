Put this at top of main.js:

`import { complexSearch_c } from './source/apiComplexSearch.js';`

Obviously, change the location of file what is appropriate.

First, you need to create the object complexSearch_c and pass in an options object holding all the parameters for the fetch call, for example:
`let complexObj = new complexSearch_c(options);`

To change all of these parameters after they are set. `complexObj.changeAll(new_options);`

To actually initiate a search, just call the function complexSearch_f from the class complexSearch_c and pass the object inside:
`await complexSearch_c.complexSearch_f(complexObj);` (the await seems to be necessary)
The data returned will be stored in the `data` field of the object, `complexObj.data` </br>

complexSearch_c.bread_t holds all the types of bread which we can prepend to the string of the query.
The bread field can be changed like this `complexObj.bread = complexSearch_c.bread_t.BAGEL`
The enum-esque object `bread_t` that is within complexSearch_c is a preferred way to set bread as all the values are appropriately spaced,
and there is autocomplete.

Schema of Data Returned:
```
number: {number} // same number value we sent in through options
offset: {number} // same offset value we sent in through options
results: {
   id: {number}
   image: {string} //image link
   imageType: {string} //jpg, png, etc
   title: {string}
}
totalResults: {number} // total number of recipes that can possibly be accessed through the query we sent (with different number, offset values of course)
```
Schema of options object to be passed in to complexSearch_c constructor (not all of the params have to be set, and they shouldn't be all set. Just use what you need. **Absolute minimum: query, number, offset, apiKey**)
