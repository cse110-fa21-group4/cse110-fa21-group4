# Call to Order
The third brainstorm meeting involving Team 4 members was called to order at 4:00 PM.

# Agenda
## Decide for sure on our first CRUD Implementation
* Will definitely be dealing with API's/Databases first and will eventually incorporate the option for a user to upload/edit/delete their
  own recipes.

## Review User Stories and Decide on a Domain
* Voting mainly between inexperienced/aspiring chefs with little time, or pet food recipes.
* Eventually the team came up with a domain that suited our team name the best: users who love bread.
* Our application will search through API's pulling recipes having anything to do with bread (making bread or contains bread).
* May also include some (brew your own beer) recipes too since it involves yeast.

## Look up some possible API's
* Han and Andy found a few API's that could sort out recipes involving bread. The API's have been shared within Slack.

## Clean Up Miro
* Review the UML Diagram Bryan had created.
* Add a few more user stories and possible features.

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 5:30 PM.
