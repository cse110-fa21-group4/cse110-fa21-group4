# Attendees:
* Alanna, Scott, Han, Xavier, Andy, Bryan, Delvin, Claire, Patrick

# Call to Order
TA meeting called to order at 7:30 PM.

# Recap/Stand Up
Went through what we have accomplished, especially during today's coding session

# Create(RUD) Implementaion 
 - Simply fetching from the API is currently not enough. We should also look into a more specific Create implementation by having the user input a url to a website with their desired recipe, and this recipe will then be uploaded into the database along with the recipes we have from Spoonacular. 
 - We should also be populating a bunch of random recipes on the homepage instead of waiting for a sure to search something.

# Fetching and uploading to a database
 - We shouldn't be fetching every time the application is opened
 - Should look into local storage, where we can call onto the recipes quicker and also handle features (such as favorites and delete) easier

# Public Website
  - Use Heroku for publishing our application
  - Could also now set the repo to public so that we can use Github Pages (can't do so on private unless we had Pro)

# PRIORITY TODO
  - Upcoming assignments (sprint meetings and video)
  - Frontend + backend work on ability for user to upload their own url
  - Backend needs to decide whether to store data locally or cache instead of fetching every time.
  - Must work on Update and Delete implementations (delete could simply be hiding a recipe from appearing on screen)

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 8:40 PM.
