# Agenda
## Review of last week
* Great job everybody!
* Feel free to self-organize in the slack.
* If one person does not meet a deadline, team loses points (did not happen last week).

## Possible stand-up meetings after thursday's lecture
* Might deduct points if we only meet virtually, should meet in person
* Quick stand-up, counts as a meeting, give an update on what you've done and what you plan to do
* Keep them to 15 min tops
* Monday's on zoom, team meeting to talk about goals for the week
  * Thursday in person stand up as mid-week update
* Poll in slack on this later

## Possible Roles
* People dropped their desired roles in slack
* No restriction on who can touch source code, but not everyone can be a dev
* (ACTION ITEM) Scott plans to make an excel sheet, need everything assigned next week. 
* Note that Han has web dev experience, Ryan can help with front-end UI. 

## Audience of our Recipe App
* Many people catering to college students
* Generalize to inexperienced audience, an app for people who are NOT experience chefs
* Prep time, calories, etc. We can use this to cater to demographics
* Everyone should try coming up with user personas

## Research Prep
* Please do research
  * Look at apps, whats good, whats bad
  * Check reviews, what do people like/not like
* Fill out useful links

## Brainstorming of ideas!
