### In Review

We as a team have made great strides in cohesivness. The main topics of the retrospective were communication and assignment delegation.
Working together on these has helped immensly since sprint 1 and we have seen a great deal of improvment from subteam leadership. 
High points from sprint 2: The shear amount of work that everyone got done, largely impart to the strict delegation of duties from most of the subteam leadership.

### Issues

We had two core issues given another sprint we would attempt to squash.
  - Long term branches creating lots of merge conflicts with other short term feature branches.
  - People working on the same things at the same time. 
 
### Fixes

1) Stricter branch policy
2) The team as a whole needs to pay more attention to daily stand ups. We also need to be professional with them as this tool specifically could of avoided these issues.
