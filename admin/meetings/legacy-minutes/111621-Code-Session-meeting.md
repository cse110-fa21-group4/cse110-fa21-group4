# 11-16-21 Meeting with Sanat

# Attendees:
* Ryan, Bryan, Alanna, Scott, Han, Xavier, Andy, David Thai

# Call to Order
TA meeting called to order at 1:00 PM.

# Testing/ADRs
 - Xavier organizated the repo and worked on the linting.

# Frontend/Design
 - Ryan, Bryan, and Han worked extensively on the frontend: fixing up the homepage, recipe list, and single recipe page view.

# Backend/API
 - Alanna, Andy, and David Thai worked on main.js to create a basic fetch implementation (used genericFetch and apiComplexSearch). For now, the api is called using the tag 'Bread', and 20 recipes are populated and console logged (will soon throw into a local database). The offset can also be managed by passing parameters during the infinite scroll we are incorporating. This will occur on the home page.

# PRIORITY TODO
  - More frontend coding to come
  - Backend must meet with frontend to incorporate the fetch into the recipe cards
  - Backend must code a searchkey function (similar to Lab 6)
  - Backend must also throw the fetched recipes into a local database

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 4:50 PM.
