Main focus of project is to focus on CRUD now, and testing it. 

Small refactoring and refinement 

Focus on unit testing with Jest first
not end to end
Get to puppeteer if time permits

Unit test the DOM, JS functions, you can simulate button presses on single html elements

Not mimicking user actions Vs just testing our code

Unit tests can be done on our DOM, JS. 

Unit testing vs End to End comes down to multiple components in a single test

CI/CD pipeline needs to include testing

Get codeclimate to work if not use code factor.io

Can create a GitHub action to work factor.io

Sanat wants us to get Jest and Puppeteer into the pipeline for testing, again the priority being Jest for unit tests and then Puppeteer and End to End if time permits.

LIGHTHOUSE dev tool is pretty awesome, gives us feedback on our website. Can add lighthouse report to REPO for testing purposes.

Crossbrowser integration testing
