# 11-02-21 Meeting with Sanat, Andy, Scott and Alanna

# Call to Order
TA meeting called to order at 6:30 PM.

# Notes:

# DAILY ASYNC STANDUPS WILL BECOME MANDATORY AND SUB TEAM LEADS NEED TO GO TO WEEKLY TA MEETING

Local storage, key value pairs: to store the users. If creating accounts, just one “account” and just store user’s name and password. But don’t need a log-in ultimately. Everything is just within local storage (within the user’s browser).

Local storage gets wiped only if you delete cache and cookies, this helps us avoid user logins and passwords. We can just use local storage if we want.

Log-in would be an add-in feature, don’t need a database.

Can have google authentication (sign in with google).

Figure out: if we want to support multiple users, how are we going to make sure they have specific things to them (favs, tags, etc). 

Under local storage is also something called IndexDB.

Backend and api together can explore API’s and look at the data format (json), getting the media out and throwing it up on the screen.

# Recipes
  - the current goal is 1500 total recipes or around there. We need to start searching for bread only then expand out to nagels, croissants, pancakes etc. 

# PRIORITY TODO
  - Frontend team needs to look at wireframes with design team and replicate structure in static html tablets/templates. Priority being all templates that use RECIPES directly i.e. recipe card and list of recipes. No css or styling required just raw html.
  - Need to get to a point at end of week where api and backend team can plug things into front end templates.
  - Backend and API need to explore apis, fetch recipes, etc. 
  - Starting next week we ideally need to be writing CRUD. USE LAB 6 code that we wrote not what was given.

# TODO
  - Need to add a little more detail to wireframes, possibly some more style/aesthetic. Maybe get away from recipe card homepage. Structure of wireframes are good. Need to style in a way that is unique to us. We have a unique idea reflect that in design.
 
# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 7:30 PM.
