# Agenda
## Continue brainstorming after having met with Sanat on Tuesday where we recieved advice for brainstorming.
* Discuss everything Sanat gave pointers on.

## Basic CRUD Implementation
* Discuss 2 options: Users uploading and updating their own recipes, or users searching the web (API's) for recipes and updating it.
* Take on one approach first, then eventually include both.
* Will begin with API's/Databases. So we will scan the API's for recipes using a familiar format/schema and input it into our database.
* Once we take on the user uploading their own recipes, it will follow a basic recipe format.

## Starting Features
* Basic search toolbar first!!!
* Get the search working, then expand off of that.
* Basic reading and writing files (File IO).

## User Stories/Domain
* Everyone added in a couple user stories of varying user backgrounds onto Miro.
* Next meeting the group will view all user stories and come to a decision for a target audience/domain.

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 8:00 PM.
