#Sprint 1 Retrospective
###The team went through a Retrium session 
#Most Important Topics and Changes
- Restructuring and renewd emphasis of subTeam lead positions and assignment due dates
- Comunication between teams was sub optimal therefore we have added members from each team to other team channels in slack to facilitate tighter comms
- We are transitioning members from certain teams to assist and accomadate teams with heavier workloads
- Currently the weakest component of our team is communication and a lack of direction due to a laid back leadership(imo)
- Going forward an emphasis on direct delegation of duties and due dates will come down from comanagers to subteam leads to team members
