Demoing most up to date version to Sanat

Testing

Backend move to testing if they can
We need test case suites for each .js file
Each developer suggests two test cases for each file they contribute to
Two unit tests
Ideally someone who didn’t	write the code should write the tests
Theoretically someone can write a test just based off of the documentation
Start by testing basic function return values
Then test the more involved functions that manipulate local storage
Just check if object put in to local with no error and check if read from local for no errors
Test CRUD functionality mainly

Coverage report - try tog et 80% 

Entire class is behind on unit testing
Therefore they will be lenient

Try to involve entire team on testing
Try to get good coverage report through Jest by adding —coverage

Styling and css stuff okay but mainly focus on TESTING
