Sanat meeting #4

Todays lecture covered deployment options but WE are just using Github.

ADR assignment and CI/CD

Deployment is a particular branch on github pages

Have RYAN AND HAN send Sanat screenshots of templates host html on live server

Emphasis on Bread recipes add bread related recipes as needed for recipe management criteria 

Pure Bread recipes at the forefront

Main focus going forward

Need to get back end up on html templates

And wireframes finished - we need prototypes

UI/design needs to ball out - we need prototypes



***************************Goal for this week

Front end finish recipe card template map out structure as much as possible
Hand over to back end and api
API write code to fetch recipe and return either evaluated or raw form Json
Back end fetch recipes that api gets and link up with front end to write javascript to display 

Get page for displaying recipe and fetching using API by end of this week (OH BOY) - CR “Create and read”

INTEGRATE API CALL WITH JAVASCRIPT AND UI (END OF THIS WEEK) FUCK 101 MIDTERM OH GOD GONNA DIE
FEEL LIKE DEAD
GONNA DIE
JESUS FUCK
OH GAWD

PRIORITIZE GETTING RECIPE CARD TO WORK

Work on these two assignments incrementally (ADR and CI/CD) 
ADR - Assignment (Example decision - API vs Database etc.) Spoonacular vs Other APIs (ADRs need to be ADDED) has checkpoints
CI/CD pipeline assignment is incremental - try to meet deadlines in the assignment even though it is done 
DO NOT LET THESE SIT DO THEM INCREMENTALLY

Agile assignments

Review and retrospective

Team status video of Pipeline and templates/demos

Create project title board in GitHub projects

Divide tasks week by week
Organize issues in some meaningful way
And actions 

More stuff

Use code factor etc. for checking code

Human review/code before merge

JS Docs

HTML Docs

CSS Docs

Get CI/CD GOING

We can set up CI/CD and testing

Create issues for working on pipeline
