# 11-17-21 Meeting with Sanat

# Attendees:
* Ryan, Bryan, Alanna, Scott, David Thai, David Liu, Claire

# Call to Order
TA meeting called to order at 3:00 PM.

# Notes
  - Backend showed Ryan (frontend) how the fetching works so far.
  - Ryan reiterated what he needed from backend: a working searchkey function like lab 6 which will require specific keys that will grab a desired recipe. We should then be able to get all parts of this recipe such as the ingrediants, photo, instructions, etc.
  - Scott went over Sanat's suggestions for us from the TA meeting last night and reexamined the "soft" deadlines.

# Adjournment
There being no further business to discuss, the meeting was adjourned at 3:50 PM.
