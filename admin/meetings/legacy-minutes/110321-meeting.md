* Need to revisit our wireframes, going forward finalize a well designed layout that screams NaN bread.
* Allows for our application's front-end team to style with our team branding in mind
## Limiting domain: Should we do just making bread, or all use-bread recipes
* Deciding how far to widen the scope of our bread recipies, e.g do hotdogs count as sandwiches?
* Should reach for 1500-2000 recipies within our domain so we can begin to expand our recipie search to include 
## Organizing code within Repo
