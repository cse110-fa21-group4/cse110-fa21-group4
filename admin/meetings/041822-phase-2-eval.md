# Phase 2: Repo Evaluation

## Meeting Information

**Date/Location:** 04-18-22 @ 3:00 PM, Zoom

**Present:** Eric, Peder, Kai, Lucius, Jon, Nat, TJ, Xavier, Anh, Rodney

**Absent:** None

## Tasks

**Current Objective:** Pick the project we will be moving forward with between the two highest scoring ones from phase 1.

**Unresolved tasks:** Finish up evaluation/rating summary for phase 1 and turn in on Canvas, create phase 2 presentation and turn in on Canvas

**Current tasks:** See objective

**Undiscussed tasks/TODO:** Familiarize ourselves with repo before the next meeting (at least skim through it)

## Decisions

The projects evaluated were Cirillo, a pomodoro timer, and Knead It, a recipe manager.

Below are the areas we considered in our evaluation:

**CI/CD:** Similar, Knead It has less testing but that should be fairly simple to add in

**Pushing a change:** Fairly streamlined in both, no issues found

**Which one we are more excited to work on:** [Winner -- Knead It](https://strawpoll.com/polls/xVg7dL58QZr/results)

**Familiarity:** Most of our team came from the recipe manager iteration of CSE 110, so they are familiar with the ideas and perhaps ideas from their own recipe books we can add to this project

**Areas to improve:** Add backend, improve UI, more filtering & export functionality & search (Knead It), improve stats list & task list (Cirillo)

**Final choice:** Knead It, more enthusiasm for the project and our group has more familiarity overall with it; state of project (in terms of repo, functionality) are similar enough and catching documentation/testing up to our standards would take little enough time that it wasnâ€™t a major factor

**End Time:** 4:00 PM
